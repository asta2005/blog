        Throughout the Greek era of the series, Kratos is portrayed as a Spartan warrior who becomes known as the "Ghost of Sparta" 
        after accidentally killing his family due to the trickery of his former mentor Ares, the God of War.
         He later avenges the deaths of his family and becomes a god himself as the new "God of War" on killing Ares,
          learning himself to be the son of Zeus. Kratos embarks on several adventures in attempts to avert disaster and change his fate, 
          portrayed as oblivious to all else and stoic, bloodthirsty,
           and arrogant in nature, engaging in morally ambiguous activities and acts of extreme violence,
            while frequently questioning himself, undergoing bouts of severe guilt and self-hate, attempting suicide several times,
             and generally being portrayed as a tragic figure, as installments focus on Kratos' origins and his relationships with his family and the Olympian gods.
              In the Norse era of the series, Kratos finds himself controlling his rage and learning how to truly be a father and mentor to his son, Atreus, helping him come to terms with his divinity.
               Along their journey,
               they combat monsters and gods of the Norse realm, of whom they make enemies, which leads to the battle of Ragnar√∂k,
         and Kratos coming to terms with his godhood..</p>

            In designing Kratos, God of War (2005) creator and game director David Jaffe attempted to create a character that looked brutal,
             but did not resemble a typical traditional Greek hero.[7]
              The character would not wear traditional armor as Jaffe wanted him to be individualistic.[7]
               Although using a fully masked character was initially approved, the concept was abandoned as the design seemed "soulless"
                and lacked a "defined personality".[7] Some models included unconventional elements,
                 such as Kratos carrying an infant on his back,[7]
             while others had excessive detail, such as long hair and other "flowing things"..</p>
